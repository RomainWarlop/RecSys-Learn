# Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative

This code is in development. I do not guarantee at all the results :)

I start with the RBM code with tensorflow of [JackSullivan] that I tried to adapt to the collaborative filtering frameworkd 
using [Hinton] paper.

The test file contains a test code with a lot of comments that I hope will be useful. I also tried to put some comments in the rbmcf.py code.

For now the learning is done only by CD1. I will update this to make CD1 for few epochs, then CD3, then CD5 etc ...
